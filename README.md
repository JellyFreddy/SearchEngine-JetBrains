# SearchEngine-JetBrains
a simple searching engine.
1) it can read information to data base either from standard inpur or from a file called "text.txt" (has to be in the root repository of the project).
2) searches information using three standard regimes: ALL, ANY, NONE.
3) the data is stored using inverted index map, which allows to optimise the time required to find necessary line.
